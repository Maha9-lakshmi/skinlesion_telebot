# skinlesion_telebot 
It is a Telebot that categorises three forms of skin lesions: measles, chicken pox, monkey pox, and normal skin.In this case, I utilised the "MobileNetV2" Pre-trained CNN model to categorise the photos in Telebot.After completing the model, I attached the telebot to it. The Telegram bot has analysed the input images to classify the input with confidence (% of correctness).
